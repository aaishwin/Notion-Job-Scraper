# Notion-Job-Scraper
DISCLAIMER:
This project was built for educational purposes only.
It is not intended to be used in violation of any site's Terms of Service.

This program scrapes jobs and adds them to a notion document, using keywords from a text file you populated. 
### ⚠️ Important Notice
Due to recent updates to Indeed’s anti-bot measures (403 errors for all non browser traffic), this scraper may fail without additional bot evasion techniques.

To fix this, future improvements would include:
- Headless browser automation (e.g., Selenium, Playwright)
- IP rotation or proxy usage
- More sophisticated user-agent + referrer spoofing
