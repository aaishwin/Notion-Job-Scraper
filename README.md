# Notion-Job-Scraper
Scrapes jobs and adds them to a notion document, using keywords from a text file you populated. 
### ⚠️ Important Notice
Due to recent updates to Indeed’s anti-bot measures (403 errors for all non-browser traffic), this scraper may fail without additional bot evasion techniques.

To fix this, future improvements would include:
- Headless browser automation (e.g., Selenium, Playwright)
- IP rotation or proxy usage
- More sophisticated user-agent + referrer spoofing
